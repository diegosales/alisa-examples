# Tutorial on ReqSpec and Verify
The SimpleControlSystem is used as an example for a tutorial on the use of *ReqSpec* for system requirement specification and on *Verify* for specification of verification plans and user-defined verification methods.

This project set depends on *AlisaPredefined* as well as on *CyberPhysical*, i.e., you will have to check those two projects out from *alisa-examples* as well.

The tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/osate/alisa-examples/blob/master/Documentation/BasicRequirementSpecificationGuidance.md)
